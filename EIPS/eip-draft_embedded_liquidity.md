## Abstract

<!--
  The Abstract is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) technical summary. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the specification section. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification does.

This Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) introduces a standard for embedding Bonding Curve-like liquidity into
Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) without modifying the ERC721 standard. The proposed standard allows the attachment of an
embedded liquidity contract, referred to as Tradable Shares, to an ERC721 NFT. Tradable Shares leverage a Bonding
Curve-like approach to attract liquidity, enabling trading of shares based on the bonding curve price formula.

## Motivation

<!--
  This section is optional.

  The motivation section should include a description of any nontrivial problems the EIP solves. It should not describe how the EIP solves those problems, unless it is not immediately obvious. It should not describe why the EIP should be made into a standard, unless it is not immediately obvious.

  With a few exceptions, external links are not allowed. If you feel that a particular resource would demonstrate a compelling case for your EIP, then save it as a printer-friendly PDF, put it in the assets folder, and link to that copy.

The ERC721 standard lacks a specific mechanism for embedding bonding curve-based liquidity, limiting the creative
possibilities for NFT-based projects. This EIP addresses the need for a standardized approach to integrate bonding curve
contracts seamlessly into ERC721 NFTs, allowing for diverse and innovative implementations without modifying the ERC721
standard.

## Specification

<!--
  The Specification section should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (besu, erigon, ethereumjs, go-ethereum, nethermind, or others).

  It is recommended to follow RFC 2119 and RFC 8170. Do not remove the key word definitions if RFC 2119 and RFC 8170 are followed.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
"NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

1.  Bonding Curve-Embedded Liquidity / Tradable Shares Contract:
    - An embedded bonding curve-based liquidity contract can be attached to an ERC721 NFT without altering the ERC721
      standard.
    - The bonding curve contract manages the liquidity of the associated NFT through a bonding curve mechanism.

2.  Liquidity Mechanisms:
    - The embedded liquidity contract can implement various liquidity mechanisms, such as bonding curves, liquidity
      locking with ERC20 tokens, or native ETH liquidity pools.
    - The standard allows for flexibility in choosing the liquidity mechanism, depending on the implementation
      requirements.

3.  Bonding Curve Mechanism:
    - The bonding curve determines the price of the NFT "keys" (sometimes also referred to as "shares") in relation to
      its supply, encouraging liquidity providers to buy and sell NFT shares based on the curve's formula.
    - Creators may customize the bonding curve parameters, such as slope, intercept, or any other relevant parameters,
      to tailor the liquidity mechanism to their project's needs.

4.  Guaranteed Creative Fees:
    - The standard emphasizes the inclusion of mechanisms that guarantee creative fees for NFT creators.
    - Creators may specify and receive a percentage of transaction fees generated by the embedded liquidity
      contract during buy and sell operations.

5.  Implementation Independence:
    - The standard is implementation-agnostic, providing developers with the freedom to choose and design the most
      suitable liquidity mechanism for their NFT projects.
    - The embedded liquidity contract can interact with ERC20 tokens or native ETH, depending on the implementation
      requirements.

## Rationale

<!--
  The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting
-->

The proposed standard focuses on enhancing the ERC721 standard by introducing a framework for embedding bonding
curve-based liquidity into NFTs. This approach provides creators with a flexible and customizable tool to attract
liquidity through bonding curve mechanisms, while ensuring creators receive guaranteed fees for their contributions.

## Security Considerations

<!--
  All EIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. For example, include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. EIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An EIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting
-->

1.  Smart Contract Security: Implementations of smart contracts should undergo thorough security audits to ensure
    resistance against vulnerabilities and attacks.

2.  Creative Fee Handling: Mechanisms for handling and distributing creative fees should be secure and transparent to
    prevent any malicious activities.

3.  Compatibility: Developers should ensure compatibility with existing ERC721 implementations, allowing for a smooth
    integration of the embedded liquidity standard.

4.  User Experience: Considerations should be made to maintain a positive user experience, avoiding complexities that
    may hinder the adoption of NFT projects utilizing embedded liquidity.

This proposal is a draft, and further community feedback and collaboration are encouraged to refine and improve the
specifications outlined herein.
