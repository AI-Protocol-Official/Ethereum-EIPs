## Abstract

<!--
  The Abstract is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) technical summary. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the specification section. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification does.

This Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) introduces a standard for embedding liquidity into Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)
without modifying the ERC721 standard. The proposed standard allows the attachment of an embedded liquidity contract to
an NFT, providing flexibility for implementing various liquidity mechanisms, including bonding curves or other
strategies. The goal is to enable creative and diverse liquidity solutions while ensuring guaranteed fees for creators.

## Motivation

<!--
  This section is optional.

  The motivation section should include a description of any nontrivial problems the EIP solves. It should not describe how the EIP solves those problems, unless it is not immediately obvious. It should not describe why the EIP should be made into a standard, unless it is not immediately obvious.

  With a few exceptions, external links are not allowed. If you feel that a particular resource would demonstrate a compelling case for your EIP, then save it as a printer-friendly PDF, put it in the assets folder, and link to that copy.

The existing ERC721 standard lacks a specific mechanism for embedding liquidity, limiting the creative possibilities
for NFT-based projects. This EIP addresses the need for a standardized approach to embed liquidity contracts seamlessly
into NFTs, allowing for diverse and innovative implementations without modifying the ERC721 standard.

## Specification

<!--
  The Specification section should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (besu, erigon, ethereumjs, go-ethereum, nethermind, or others).

  It is recommended to follow RFC 2119 and RFC 8170. Do not remove the key word definitions if RFC 2119 and RFC 8170 are followed.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

1.  Embedding Liquidity Contract:
    - An embedded liquidity contract can be attached to an ERC721 NFT without altering the ERC721 standard.
    - The embedded liquidity contract is responsible for managing liquidity related to the associated NFT.
    - The embedded liquidity contract follows the interface below:

    ```
    /**
     * @title Embedded Liquidity
     *
     * @notice Embedded liquidity stores the liquidity for an NFT; it does so by offering the
     *      mechanism to buy and sell the NFT shares, hence it is also referred to as "tradeable shares"
     *
     * @notice Tradeable shares is a non-transferable, but buyable/sellable fungible token-like asset,
     *      which is sold/bought solely by the shares contract at the predefined by
     *      the bonding curve function price
     *
     * @notice The shares is bound to its "subject" â€“ an NFT; the NFT owner gets the subject fee
     *      emerging in every buy/sell operation
     */

2.  Liquidity Mechanisms:
    - The embedded liquidity contract can implement various liquidity mechanisms, such as bonding curves, liquidity
      locking with ERC20 tokens, or native ETH liquidity pools.
    - The standard allows for flexibility in choosing the liquidity mechanism, depending on the implementation
      requirements.

3.  Guaranteed Creative Fees:
    - The standard emphasizes the inclusion of mechanisms that guarantee creative fees for NFT creators.
    - Creators may specify and receive a percentage of transaction fees generated by the embedded liquidity
      contract during buy and sell operations.

4.  Implementation Independence:
    - The standard is implementation-agnostic, providing developers with the freedom to choose and design the most
      suitable liquidity mechanism for their NFT projects.
    - The embedded liquidity contract can interact with ERC20 tokens or native ETH, depending on the implementation
      requirements.

## Rationale

<!--
  The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting
-->

The proposed standard aims to enhance the ERC721 standard by introducing a framework for embedding liquidity contracts
into NFTs. This flexibility encourages creativity and innovation in designing liquidity mechanisms while ensuring that
creators receive guaranteed fees for their contributions.

## Security Considerations

<!--
  All EIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. For example, include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. EIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An EIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting
-->

1.  Smart Contract Security: Implementations of smart contracts should undergo thorough security audits to ensure
    resistance against vulnerabilities and attacks.

2.  Creative Fee Handling: Mechanisms for handling and distributing creative fees should be secure and transparent to
    prevent any malicious activities.

3.  Compatibility: Developers should ensure compatibility with existing ERC721 implementations, allowing for a smooth
    integration of the embedded liquidity standard.

4.  User Experience: Considerations should be made to maintain a positive user experience, avoiding complexities that
    may hinder the adoption of NFT projects utilizing embedded liquidity.

This proposal is a draft, and further community feedback and collaboration are encouraged to refine and improve the
specifications outlined herein.
